About me

I'm a computer scientist with experience in network system development, data analysis and machine learning.

Since 2015 I have been dedicated in the academic area, through research work in the area of wireless network at the Federal University of Minas Gerais(UFMG - BRAZIL), specifically in the <a href="http://www.winet.dcc.ufmg.br/doku.php">WINET laboratory</a>.

I pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the UFMG, under the supervision of professor <a href="https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~damacedo/About_Me.html">Daniel Macedo</a>. My research interests are mostly related to Machine Learning applications, wireless network... I'm still defining!
